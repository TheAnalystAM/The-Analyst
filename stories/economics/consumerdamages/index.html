    <p>Trump’s tariff actions have received immense global attention from government officials, Wall Street moguls and the everyday consumer.</p>


    <p>In early February, Trump began implementing tariffs on countries worldwide. For starters, he implemented a 25% tariff on foreign steel and aluminum. He then went on to impose steep reciprocal tariffs that were later reduced to 10% across the board, 25% duties on foreign car imports and a combined 145% reciprocal tariff on Chinese imported goods. </p>

    <p>Amid the infighting, governing bodies such as the European Union have attempted to mitigate damages by proposing a mutual zero-tariff agreement, while China has gone toe-to-toe with the Trump administration, imposing 125% retaliatory tariffs on American imported goods.</p>

    <p>Trump’s sudden actions have left many consumers reeling as they wonder how tariffs will impact their wallets and assets.</p>

    <div id="subheader">Direct tariff impacts</div>
    
    <p>With global trade helplessly intertwined, it's hard to know the complete impact of tariffs. However, history will show that a few consequences are all but certain.</p>


    <p>The most near-term impact we’re already seeing unfold is a stock market decline.</p>


    <p>On April 8, U.S. stocks momentarily dipped into a bear market, or a decline of over 20% from all-time highs. The Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100 experienced similar steep declines as the potential for higher inflation and slower growth weighed on investors.</p>


    <p>The performance of the stock market creates a variety of problems for individuals, regardless of age. A slowdown in growth means jobs may be at risk, while dips in 401(k) and Roth IRA accounts may delay retirement plans for individuals near the end of their careers.</p>


    <p>As for the more long-term consequences of tariffs, CEOs from companies like BlackRock and JPMorgan have publicly stated that they believe a recession, which is defined as two consecutive quarters of decline in America’s GDP, is on the horizon.</p>


    <p>Analysts fear that abruptly severing the U.S.’s economic ties with its global trade partners will slow our economy, given that America’s historic globalist trade policy has long stimulated growth and development.</p>


    <p>Take China, which is one of the U.S.’s largest trade partners. $440 billion of imported goods from China to the U.S. are set to become more costly thanks to tariffs, a higher cost that will hamper U.S. business activity.</p>

    <p>The scariest outcome that economists are forecasting is a potential loss of faith in the U.S. dollar and federal treasury bills, the backbones of the global financial system.</p>


    <p>“The U.S. was always seen as the safest place, even when we had the global financial crisis about 15 years ago. They actually put money into the U.S., because this is the safe haven,” Mary Lovely, an economics professor at Syracuse University, said.</p>


    <p>Tariff uncertainty has upended this once widely held assumption.</p>


    <p>The U.S. is seen as a much less safe place for investors to park their savings, leading foreigners to sell dollars and U.S. treasuries. This will increase interest rates, forcing the federal government to pay higher premiums on its debt, which ultimately comes out of the pockets of American taxpayers.</p>


    <p>A great concern for many is that the prices of popular products consumers love and use every day will begin to rise. For example, tech companies reliant on Chinese production, such as Apple, are bound to raise iPhone prices due to the 20% fentanyl tariff on China, which is not subject to exemption. Every subsequent increase in everyday prices lowers the amount of money consumers have to put toward housing, transportation, and leisure.</p>


    <p>China’s refusal to back down from a trade war has led to a ban on exports of 7 rare minerals commonly used in America’s defense, energy, and automotive sectors. To this day, China holds a monopoly in this vital sector, accounting for roughly 92% of the global heavy rare earth element processing and 61% of production.</p>

    <p>Given a lack of alternative mineral sources, American defense companies such as Lockheed Martin, RTX, and Boeing are left praying for tariff reprieve, with their stock price plummeting and sector sentiment on a razor’s edge.</p>


    <p>However, on the plus side, consumers have started to see gasoline prices decrease as tariffs take hold. The national average price per gallon has reached $3.13, nearly 50 cents lower than last year and eight cents lower than the week prior.</p>


    <p>While there appear to be certain benefits to Trump’s tariff plans, as of now, tariffs are set to do more harm than good for the consumer. Luckily, the recent 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs has seemed to improve matters somewhat, as seen in the S&P 500’s 9.5% surge following the news. However, for the everyday consumer, we should start considering what might happen after this 3-month reprieve is over, and how things might start to get even more expensive.</p>
