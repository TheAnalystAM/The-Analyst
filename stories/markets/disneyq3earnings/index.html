    <p>Disney <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disneys-q3-fy24-earnings-results-webcast/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">reported its fiscal third-quarter earnings</a> on Wednesday, recording a profit from its combined streaming services for the first time while displaying a decline in income from its parks division.</p>

    <p>The company’s direct-to-consumer streaming business, which includes Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, recorded operating income of $47 million, compared to a loss of $512 million in the prior-year period. Disney had previously expected its combined streaming services to achieve profitability by the current quarter.</p>

    <p>While Disney’s streaming services recorded gains, the company’s parks division saw a 3% decrease, or $75 million, in operating income compared to the prior year. The company attributed the decline to higher operating costs due to inflation, increased technological spending and a “moderation of consumer demand” towards the end of the quarter.</p>

    <p>Overall, the company posted Q3 revenue of $23.2 billion, exceeding the $23.1 billion analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter also beat expectations, coming out to $1.39 per share versus the $1.19 analysts expected.</p>

    <p>Thanks to “strong consolidated” performance in the prior quarter, Disney raised its full-year adjusted EPS growth target to 30%, up from 25% prior.</p>

    <p>After quarterly earnings were released, Disney’s stock increased slightly before slumping back down. Shares ended the day down 4.5% and continued to decrease in after-hours trading. Coming into the results, Disney stock remained roughly unchanged this year.</p>

    <p>Looking forward, Disney said it remains “on track” to improve the profitability of its direct-to-consumer streaming business this quarter. The company also expects DTC Entertainment and ESPN+ to be profitable in the fourth quarter.</p>

    <p>The company said in the statement that it is focused on “improving margins over the coming years.” One step Disney has already taken towards this goal is announcing plans to <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-streaming-playlists/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">once again increase the cost</a> of Disney+ and Hulu+ subscriptions while expanding access to ABC News Live and kids playlists for subscribers.</p>

    <p>The future seems cloudier for Disney’s parks division. The company said it expects the demand moderation the company saw in Q3 to “impact the next few quarters.”</p>

    <p>“While we are actively monitoring attendance and guest spending and aggressively managing our cost base, we expect Q4 experiences segment operating income to decline by mid-single digits versus the prior year, reflecting these underlying dynamics,” the company said in its release.</p>

    <p>Disney said a reduction in “normal consumer travel” to Disneyland Paris due to the Olympics and “cyclical softening” in China also contributed to declining parks revenue.</p>

    <p>Disney’s theatrical performance is one bright spot from Q3 earnings that was <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-reports-second-quarter-and-six-months-earnings-for-fiscal-2024/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">absent in Q2</a>, with “Inside Out 2” buoying the company’s content sales and licensing operating income to $254 million from a loss of $112 million in the prior year. Disney is expected to continue commanding the box office later this year with the release of “Moana 2” and “Mufasa: The Lion King”.</p>
