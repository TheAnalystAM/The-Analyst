    <p>Should we embrace an authority that could reliably solve all of our problems?</p>


    <p>The notion, which has broken free from the hypothetical with the invention of enterprise artificial intelligence, seems obvious yet discomforting. Society has always sought tools to make our lives easier, from computers to machinery. Still, the idea of cutting humans out of the problem-solving process entirely raises fresh questions of purpose or, more nihilistically, replacement.</p>


    <p>Yet, instead of playing off these anxieties, AI has been quickly adopted by the population, with <a href="https://www.elon.edu/u/news/2025/03/12/survey-52-of-u-s-adults-now-use-ai-large-language-models-like-chatgpt/" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">over half of U.S. adults saying they use AI large language models like ChatGPT.</a> Students, companies, workers and parents now rely on enterprise AI to enhance or replace processes once conducted by humans.</p>


    <p>As algorithms increasingly replace individual decision-making and judgment, our world loses something very important: The ability to think critically. Asking AI to think for us cedes our personal agency to a third party, undermining our sense of purpose.</p>

    <p>AI’s appeal stems from its ability to cut down on heavy lifting. Already, AI has been integrated into everyday tools to make time-intensive tasks easier. <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/article/the-surprising-power-of-next-word-prediction-large-language-models-explained-part-1/" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;"> Large Language Models,</a> which predict sequences of words to create coherent phrases, can write essays within seconds. Similar tools can conduct data entry and processing using <a href="https://auth.services.adobe.com/en_US/deeplink.html#/jump/complete" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">Optical Character Recognition (OCR), </a>while <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;"> GitHub Copilot</a> and<a href="https://codeassist.google" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">Google Gemini Code Assist</a>  assist coders by analyzing programming languages and providing code suggestions, leading to faster software development.</p>

    <p>Google is a prominent example of these new tools at work, with the company adapting its search engine to incorporate generative AI features. Now, when searching online, the top of the screen flashes “AI Overview," providing a brief summary of what was found with each search.</p>


    <p>Still, Google search summary seems like a gimmick when compared to large language models, which are making waves in everything from education to data analytics to creative writing.</p>

    <p>The key to LLMs’ broad adoption is that they are free to use, easy to learn and remarkably powerful. Programs such as <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">OpenAI’s</a> ChatGPT can generate text answers that are indistinguishable from a human. They can solve math problems that PhDs would struggle to solve, and even <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/list-here-are-the-exams-chatgpt-has-passed-so-far-2023-1" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;"> pass the LSAT with flying colors.</a></p>

    <p>The problem with AI is what makes it so great in the first place: it's almost too powerful. It has become astonishingly easy to cede tasks, most concerningly those in which the process is just as important as the final result, to LLMs.</p>

    <p>Integrating LLMs into a learning environment, for example, raises major concerns about how long students are spending on the process of reasoning, problem-solving and overcoming hurdles in their learning. While such moments can be painful for already busy students, they are <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10670526/" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">crucial for developing critical thinking skills.</a></p>

    <p>Wielding AI, students realize that earning higher grades can be achieved without the tedious process of working on projects. Fast answers take precedence over well-thought-out ones as students increasingly cede their critical capacity to AI.</p>

    <p>In the professional world, AI is being quickly adopted by organizations, while leaving workers to fret over the possibility of replacement.</p>

    <p>“Artificial minds won’t just aid humans,” writes David Duvenaud in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/may/04/the-big-idea-can-we-stop-ai-making-humans-obsolete" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">piece for the Guardian,</a> “they’ll quietly take over in countless small ways, initially because they’re cheaper, eventually because they’re genuinely better than even our best performers.”</p>

     <img src="/img/aisocietytwo.png" id="bodyphoto">

    <div id="photocredit">Guillem de Balanzó</div>

    <p>An example of this is in the legal field. Within larger firms, AI can enhance productivity while offering more promising client outcomes. AI is projected to significantly cut down on time spent collecting information, freeing up attorneys to spend more time on creating stronger strategies and improving counsel's quality of service.</p>

    <p>The transformation is already taking place from the bottom up.<a href="https://pro.bloomberglaw.com/insights/technology/how-is-ai-changing-the-legal-profession/#how-technology-is-changing-the-legal-field" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">Work typically handed to entry-level employees is now often being completed by machine learning tools instead.</a> For example, it is common for first-year associates to conduct the time-consuming tasks of legal research and creating briefs for their supervisors.  Now, AI-powered search engines and legal research tools can sift through large quantities of documents to pinpoint information in an instant. LLMs can also draft legal briefs with minor prompting.</p>

    <p>“AI may cause the ‘80/20 inversion.” <a href="https://clp.law.harvard.edu/knowledge-hub/insights/the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-law-law-firms-business-models/" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">says</a> Robert Couture, Senior Research Fellow at Harvard Law, “80 percent of time was spent collecting information, and 20 percent was strategic analysis and implications. We’re trying to flip those timeframes.”</p>

    <p>AI can be a powerful force for good in the hands of good-faith agencies. However, like most tools, its power can be used to subvert and disrupt when used by bad actors.</p>

    <p>Specifically, AI is a remarkably powerful tool for disruption. The technology can create deep fakes, which are images and videos that depict fictional events in a realistic manner that can trick audiences. Left unchecked, these dupes could tear at our social cohesion, blurring the line between what's real and what's fabricated.</p>

    <p>A notable example was a 2022 video of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/19/russia-ukraine-infowar-deepfakes" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy</a>  asking his army to surrender to Russian forces. Ukrainian officials had previously warned the public of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/16/1087062648/deepfake-video-zelenskyy-experts-war-manipulation-ukraine-russia" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">Russia’s informational warfare, </a>with state-sponsored deepfakes being spread to sow confusion and undermine public trust.</p>

    <p>Nobody is safe from having their likeness featured in a deepfake video. In March  2023, images of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/style/article/pope-francis-puffer-coat-ai-fashion-lotw" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">Pope Francis wearing a white puffer jacket</a> went viral, confusing viewers with an unusual fashion choice for someone of the Pope’s station. Much more sinisterly, trolls spread explicit deepfakes of <a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/meeting/house/116778/documents/HHRG-118-JU03-20240202-SD002.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">Taylor Swift </a>across the web, stirring anger among her fan base.</p>

    <p>The disparaging of brand images and tearing of social fabrics wrought by deepfakes is a quantifiable harm. In a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/online-fake-news-costing-us-78-billion-globally-each-year/" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">study</a> conducted by the University of Baltimore and Cybersecurity firm CHEQ, fake news and misinformation cost “the global economy $78 billion” in 2020 alone.</p>

    <p>The problem is only getting worse. Within the last few years, the volume of deepfakes shared online has grown exponentially, <a href="https://cybernews.com/privacy/report-number-of-expert-crafted-video-deepfakes-double-every-six-months/#:~:text=Over%2085%20thousand%20harmful%20deepfake%20videos%2C%20crafted%20by%20expert%20creators%2C%20were%20detected%20up%20to%20December%202020%2C%20claims%20a%20recently%20published%20report%20%E2%80%98The%20State%20of%20Deepfakes%202020%E2%80%99.%20The%20number%20of%20expert%2Dcrafted%20videos%20has%20been%20doubling%20every%20six%20months%20since%20observations%20started%20in%20December%202018." target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;"> doubling every six months.</a> In 2023, around 500,000 deepfake videos and voice memos were shared on social media. Researchers predict this number will balloon to <a href="https://www.openfox.com/deepfakes-and-their-impact-on-society/" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;"> 8 million in 2025.</a></p>

    <p>Unauthorized dissemination and creation of deepfakes can result in defamation and infringement of intellectual property suits. However, as of the time of publication, there is no comprehensive federal law that regulates or bans deepfakes, making enforcement difficult.</p>

    <p>Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) are trying to change this with newly introduced legislation that would regulate the disclosure, creation and dissemination of deepfake content included in the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/2065" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">Deepfake Report Act of 2019.</a></p>

    <p>As we get ever closer to creating technology that surpasses our own ability,, we must always consider where our sense of purpose stands within this new framework. What comes next for humanity should increasingly become a consideration as we discuss replacement by AI, rather than assistance.</p>

    <p>With all this in mind, if asked again whether we should embrace an authority that could reliably solve all of our problems, how would you choose to answer? Or, should we as a population figure out our next step before we cede the future to a technology with no qualms over our well-being?</p>
