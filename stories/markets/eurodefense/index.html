    <p>European defense sector stocks dipped this week, shedding gains made following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory over Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the U.S. presidential election.</p>

    <p>While defense shares steeply rose following Trump’s win, returning to the White House a president who has pressured European nation-states to meet NATO military spending requirements, markets are now reckoning with the uncertainty a second Trump term could bring. Trump’s recent cabinet nominations further stoked investor concerns, with many seeing the controversial selections as a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/brooks-and-capehart-on-the-chaos-surrounding-trumps-cabinet-picks" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">precursor</a> to a chaotic administrative term.</p>

    <p>Uncertainty over the Ukrainian War also contributed to defense stocks’ decline. Trump reiterated this week <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/brooks-and-capehart-on-the-chaos-surrounding-trumps-cabinet-picks" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">plans</a> to end the Russia-Ukraine War shortly after taking office, an outcome that would decrease the number of multi-billion dollar military contracts defense firms could grapple over.</p>

    <p>Shares of British aerospace and defense companies <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LSE-RR./" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">Rolls-Royce Holdings</a> and <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LSE-BA./" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">BAE Systems</a> declined 6.11% and 9.4% this past week, respectively. Swedish defense conglomerate <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OMXSTO-SAAB_B/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">Saab ADR</a> posted a 2.75% decline while Italian defense and security behemoth <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/MIL-LDO/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">Leonardo S.p.A</a> dropped 5.48%.</p>

    <p>German security firm <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XETR-RHM/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">Rheinmetall</a>, Europe’s 5th largest defense company, was a rare exception in an otherwise sector-wide selloff. The firm posted 0.82% growth this week, contributing to a monthly increase of 15.67%.</p>

    <p>NATO’s European member states already <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/european-countries-spending-defense-tank-115632190" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">spend</a> 50% more on defense than they did 10 years ago. However, a recent <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/european-countries-spending-defense-tank-115632190" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">report</a> from the International Institute for Strategic Studies found that European military spending is still insufficient to properly deter Russia.</p>

    <p>“Forces, budgets and defense-industrial capacities were reduced because of political decisions by governments,” the London-based think tank said in a report released this week, “These same governments now need to rediscover the ‘muscle memory’ of defense and security, ensuring sustained policy attention and investment to meet the new strategic realities in Europe.”</p>

    <div id="subheader">A rare moment of weakness</div>

    <p>Despite recent headwinds, the European defense industry has far outperformed the market this year. Amidst the Russia-Ukraine War and Isreal-Gaza Conflict, defense spending has <a href="https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2024-04/2404_fs_milex_2023.pdf" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">increased</a> 6.8% globally, its sharpest rise since 2009.</p>

    <p>Europe’s largest defense firms have seen revenues skyrocket due to the recent uptick in military spending. Shares of defense stocks have risen as much as 150% this past year as firms secured multi-billion dollar government contracts to produce drones, tanks, fighter jets and bombs.</p>

    <p>Some analysts see the Russia-Ukraine war as a much-needed wake-up call for European countries who have long neglected domestic defense capacity. The past 25 years since the Cold War’s end have seen European state defense budgets shrink, defense stockpiles diminish and military-industrial output decline, inhibiting Europe’s current ability to support Ukraine.</p>

    <p>“The idea of spheres of influence doesn’t belong in the 21st century”, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said during a European Parliament meeting in early 2022, “Diplomacy has not spoken its last word yet, but now deeds have to follow.”</p>

    <p>While enthusiasm for increased defense spending has grown among European nations, some countries are experiencing difficulties budgeting for military spending hikes. Germany’s 2025 federal budget earmarked €53 billion ($55.9 billion) for military spending, €5 billion less than German defense minister Boris Pistorius initially requested.</p>

    <p>“This would in no way do justice to the current threat level and certainly not to Germany's responsibility in the world,” said André Wüstner, chairman of the Bundeswehrverband, an association of more than 200,000 armed forces members.</p>

    <p>Even so, defense spending appears likely to trend upward in 2025 as countries once hesitant to increase military funding join the fray. France, which has otherwise opted to slash spending across the board, raised next year’s defense budget to €50.4 billion ($55 billion) from €47.2 billion this year. Poland increased its 2025 military spending to 187 billion zylots ($48.7 billion) from 159 billion zylots, setting a defense spending record for the Central European nation.</p>

    <p>“We must promise today to our compatriots, but also to the soldiers of the Polish Armed Forces, that we will build a most modern military because today, innovation is power,” Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said at a Warsaw military parade in mid-August.</p>
