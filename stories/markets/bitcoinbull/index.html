    <div id="bodytext">
      
    <p>With less than 10 days to go until the New Year, we now definitively call <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> one of the biggest winners of 2024.</p>

    <p>The highly speculative digital currency, which Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently likened to virtual gold, has seen its value soar 140% over the past year. Much of that growth has come after the November electoral victory of Donald Trump, who <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/06/trump-claims-presidential-win-here-is-what-he-promised-the-crypto-industry-ahead-of-the-election.html" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">championed</a> cryptocurrency on the campaign trail and has nominated various pro-crypto businessmen for his cabinet.</p>

    <p>The bullishness of a crypto-forward Washington quickly pushed Bitcoin to all-time highs of over $100,000. The currency now sits around $96,000 following a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/18/fed-meeting-live-updates-traders-await-december-interest-rate-cut.html" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">Federal Reserve-fueled</a> pullback.</p>

    <p>With Bitcoin at all-time highs, many investors are left wondering whether they should join the bull run that has captured the crypto market. The question left to be answered is whether Bitcoin is more gold or fools gold at such high prices.</p>

    <p>Without the burden of cable, investors can no longer define Comcast. Is it a media company, a tech stock or a film production group? The better Comcast can cast the shadow of ambiguity over itself, the better the stock will perform in a landscape where ambiguity often equates to possibility.</p>

    <p>With a crypto-friendly administration, growing geopolitical uncertainty, the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs and capped coin supply, Bitcoin is the perfect asset to introduce to your portfolio in 2025. While some analysts’ bullishness regarding the coin is laughably <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-100-bitcoin-could-185414994.html" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">overblown</a>, the digital currency is still well-positioned to outperform the market in 2025 and beyond.</p>

    <div id="subheader">Crypto bros in the White House</div>

    <p>Love or hate President-elect Trump, it is hard to imagine any politician who could be better for Bitcoin. The former president began his foray into the cryptocurrency space during a campaign stop in July. The then-presidential nominee pitched hard to the gathering of visibly skeptical crypto bros, announcing that he would fire the current SEC chair Gary Gensler on day one of his presidency.</p>

    <p>While the crowd had <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cne4n2xdylvo" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">largely stayed silent</a> through most of his speech, Trump’s promise to fire Gensler, who is seen by the crypto community as a toxic <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65861096" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">anti-crypto</a> regulator, energized the assembly. With bold strokes and sky-high promises, Trump had enraptured his audience.</p>

    <p>While firing Gensler was an exciting first promise, what has truly fueled Bitcoin’s steep rise to  $100,000 has been the possibility of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve.</p>

    <img src="/img/trumpcrypto.webp" id="bodyphoto">

    <p>Currently, the U.S. holds vast sums of gold, oil, foreign currency and U.S. Treasury securities in reserve that can be deployed to carry out monetary policy, ensure market stability and back up the U.S. dollar. </p>

    <p>While proponents have labeled it a “reserve,” the proposed strategic Bitcoin reserve would serve a slightly different purpose.</p>

    <p>The primary use case for a new Bitcoin reserve, which under Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis’ plan would total 100,000 Bitcoins by 2030, would be to pay down the burgeoning U.S. debt without increasing taxes. The thinking goes that since Bitcoin’s value will likely appreciate in the long term, an investment in the currency today would give the Treasury ample assets to sell off later as it works to cover its debts.</p>

    <p>Another advantage a U.S. Bitcoin reserve presents is to solidify the nation’s position as the global leader in cryptocurrency. Leaked <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/12/10/leak-reveals-russias-bid-for-bitcoin-reserve-amid-huge-2025-price-predictions/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">documents</a> out of Russia confirm that its national government is considering creating its own Bitcoin reserve in 2025, with other countries presumably not far behind. If the United States can set up shop first, the move will ensure funding for crypto and crypto infrastructure flows towards the U.S. rather than geopolitical adversaries Russia and China.</p>

    <p>While Bitcoin reserve <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/fed-cant-hold-bitcoin-not-seeking-change-that-powell-says-2024-12-18/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">detractors</a> in Washington exist, the growing possibility of mass government adoption of Bitcoin in the U.S. and beyond is a compelling argument for a bull run that could continue as more and more countries jump on the bandwagon.</p>

    <div id="subheader">Uncertainty and tension</div>

    <p>If crypto is, as Powell remarked, virtual gold, then it will likely be a winner in 2025.</p>

    <p>Gold has historically been a hedge against economic instability and market turmoil given its unwavering base value. For instance, one bar of gold is still one bar of gold if the U.S. Government defaults on its debts or inflation spikes and the dollar’s value plummets.</p>

    <p>While Bitcoin doesn’t have an unwavering base value, like gold it is unaffected by rate cuts or economic shocks, making it a similarly strong hedge against uncertainty. If for example a  government topples or two countries go to war, stock markets may plummet and currencies may weaken but the value of a Bitcoin won’t change. In fact, the price of Bitcoin might actually increase as citizens move to protect their wealth, exchanging declining cash savings for Bitcoin.</p>

    <p>With the German coalition government recently collapsing, the French parliament deposing its Prime Minister, South Korea declaring martial law, tensions between the U.S. and China rising and a U.S. debt crisis looming, uncertainty is set to expand in 2025. In this context, Bitcoin seems perfectly positioned to be carried to new heights by universally concerned investors.</p>

    <div id="subheader">Wall Street’s blessing</div>

    <p>On January 10, 2024, the SEC <a href="https://www.foley.com/insights/publications/2024/01/sec-greenlights-bitcoin-etfs/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">approved</a> the launch of several Bitcoin ETFs for public exchange. Since the government’s landmark decision, over 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs have been created with a collective $100 billion in assets under management. The undertaking represents one of the most successful ETF launches in history.</p>

    <p>Now, many investors were willing to buy Bitcoin directly through crypto exchange platforms before the SEC’s ruling, with Bitcoin already logging $815 billion in market cap prior to the decision. However, many more are likely to hop on the bandwagon now that speculation on the price of Bitcoin can be conducted in familiar environments.</p>

    <div id="photocredit">A physical Bitcoin sits in front of a stock ticker trending downwards. Like gold, Bitcoin has proven to be an effective hedge against uncertainty. (photo credit: Pexels)</div>

    <p>With Bitcoin ETFs, longtime investors can bet on Bitcoin without going through the hassle of learning a new trading platform like Crypo.com or <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-COIN/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">Coinbase.</a> Investors can use Schwab, Robinhood, Fidelity or whichever traditional brokerage they choose to speculate on Bitcoin under the same rules and conditions they have come to be familiar with.</p>

    <p>The removal of unnecessary complexity around trading Bitcoin will assuredly bring in hawkish investors who had before been turned off by a alien system, with pension funds, institutional banks, hedge funds and older retail investors now joining the fold.</p>

    <div id="subheader">Only so many coins</div>

    <p>Basic economics tells us that the price of a commodity is, in essence, based on two factors: supply and demand. As mentioned previously, the demand for Bitcoin is only likely to grow as global adoption and legitimization of the coin leads to new investors being brought into the fold. So, how about supply?</p>

    <p>Unlike equities in which new shares can be issued at the whim of senior executives, the total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins. The only way to increase your stake in Bitcoin is to try and mine the measly remaining sum of 2 million unmined Bitcoins, which will be increasingly difficult due to Bitcoin <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/bitcoin-halving" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">halving</a> events, or buy coins on the open market.</p>

    <p>With only so many coins, any increase in demand will translate to a corresponding rise in Bitcoin’s price. Investors need not worry about new coins getting distributed and their positions being liquidated as could happen with corporate stock.</p>

    <div id="subheader">High risk, high reward</div>

    <p>While Bitcoin has been likened to gold, unlike gold it has no inherent base value other than what traders prescribe it. Bitcoin cannot be used to create material goods like gold can, nor is it often accepted as a form of payment like local currencies usually are.</p>

    <p>Bitcoin’s limited real-world application makes the currency highly volatile. If you don’t have the stomach for or can’t afford to take on such risk, consider a minimal investment in the coin. 
    For guidance, asset management firm BlackRock recently confirmed that about 2% of portfolio assets should be Bitcoin to properly balance the risk and potential reward of the coin.</p>

    <p>However, if you are looking to add risk to your portfolio, consider Bitcoin one of your best bets. The bullish outlook on this stock is justified for all the above reasons and more. An investment today could significantly boost your portfolio performance for years to come as Bitcoin becomes further legitimized and gains global adoption.</p>
