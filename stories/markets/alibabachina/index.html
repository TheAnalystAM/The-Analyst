    <div id="bodytext">
      
    <p>After years of being battered, Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng index, which includes many of China’s largest companies, has been on a tear. The benchmark has risen by 17% since the start of 2025, far outperforming American and European markets, which have grown -0.12% and 5.58%, respectively.</p>

    <p>None among the Hang Seng have risen so high as <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-BABA/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">Alibaba,</a> which has long acted as a sort of Chinese market bellweather given its exposure to China’s e-commerce, retail, news, internet and technology sectors. Shares are up 60% since the start of the year, bringing it to a nearly four-year high.</p>

    <p>Such significant price action is partly due to Alibaba’s own feats, including a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/alibaba-chairman-confirms-ai-partnership-with-apple-chinese-iphones-2025-02-13/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">newly minted deal with Apple to collaborate on AI features,</a> a solid beat on profit and revenue this quarter and a ratcheting up of investment in AI and cloud computing</p>

    <p>Yet much of Alibaba’s upward momentum has come from outside the organization, with investor sentiment toward the Chinese stock market all but reversing course.</p>

    <p>For years after the collapse of Chinese property giant Evergrande, which tanked the country’s stock market and sent its economy spiraling, international traders largely saw the Chinese market as uninvestable. Low consumer demand, a property sector crisis, deflation and high youth unemployment warded off even the most brazen of China bulls. </p>

    <p>2025 is a far different story. Thanks to groundbreaking innovations in AI and pharmaceuticals combined with pro-business sentiment from Chinese president Xi Jinping, investors are once again flocking to Chinese stocks, with many parking their funds in China’s largest e-commerce player.</p>

    <p>None trumpet the bull case for Alibaba and China as much as GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen, who recently upped his stake in Alibaba stock to $1 billion. As far back as 2022, the billionaire investor has bet on China’s return to global economic dominance, a position that at the time seemed far-fetched among most investor circles. </p>

    <p>“China is a sleeping giant. Let her sleep, for when she wakes she will move the world,” Ryan Cohen tweeted in June 2022.</p>

    <div id="photocredit">Alibaba founder Jack Ma announced the launch of Alibaba's Electronic World Trade Platform in 2018. The platform, which accounts for a significant share of Alibaba's revenue, is now under threat due to the possibility of new U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports. (Paul Kagame, Flickr)</div>

    <p>Despite an impressive start to the year, shares of Alibaba are now under significant pressure, threatening the e-commerce giant’s rebound story and, possibly, its ability to hold on to hard-won stock gains.</p>

    <p>On Friday, China vowed it would enact strict “countermeasures” if the U.S. raised tariffs on the country’s exported goods. The rebuttal came after President Trump threatened to double America’s 10% tariff.</p>

    <p>“If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will take all necessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests,” a Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said in a statement.</p>

    <p>Such a high tariff rate would undoubtedly hurt Alibaba’s e-commerce platform, which makes the bulk of its money by connecting U.S. corporate buyers with Chinese manufacturers. </p>

    <p>A 10% increase in the cost of doing business with Chinese exporters would incentivize U.S. companies to start looking elsewhere to buy cheap manufactured goods, such as India, Vietnam or Thailand. These are markets that Alibaba holds significantly less market share in, making a sudden pivot away from China potentially lethal to the company.</p>

    <p>And while Alibaba’s own quarterly report was solid, weak corporate earnings from a majority of Hang Seng-listed companies has soured investor sentiment on China’s economic recovery, weighing down Alibaba. Chinese corporations across industries reported that, despite strong economic growth, continued deflationary pressures and weak domestic demand dragged on profits.</p>

    <p>Alibaba stock dropped 2.11% this week from the dual pressures. In a sign of the e-commerce giant’s intertwined relationship with the Chinese stock market, the Hang Seng declined 2.26% in the same time frame.</p>

    <p>The path forward for Alibaba and, by extension, the Chinese stock market remains murky. Many analysts believe that Alibaba is long overdue to retest its all time-high of $310, a development that would surely correspond with a surge in the Hang Seng. Yet headwinds remain in how the U.S. approaches trade with China. A trade war could be devastating for both countries, just as it was during Trump’s first term.</p>

    <p>For now, all eyes are on Alibaba and its many lines of business. May China bulls be right, otherwise the country’s detractors will quickly tear into recently made gains.</p>
