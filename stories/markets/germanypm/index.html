    <div id="bodytext">
      
    <p>Germany’s economy has been stuck in a rut for the past four years. Hampered by the pandemic, an expansive energy crisis and restrictive market conditions imposed by the ruling coalition, the nation’s economy has <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/charted-germanys-stalling-real-gdp-growth-1991-2024/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">grown</a> a measly 2.4% since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>

    <p>While bleak, the recent <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/11/13/german-chancellor-scholz-resolves-to-hold-snap-elections-on-february-23_6732705_4.html" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">implosion</a> of Prime Minister Olaf Scholtz’s ruling coalition and the sudden calling of snap elections for Feb. 23 guarantees a shake-up will happen sooner than many had anticipated. With the ruling Social Democratic Party of Germany lagging in the polls, a change of governance is all but certain, which could greatly benefit a domestic market long stricken by stagnation.</p>

    <p>The Christian Democratic Union, Germany’s center-right party largely <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/germany/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">favored</a> to win the snap election, embraces the free-market, pro-business principles that could restore consistent economic growth to the Fatherland. Having undergone a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4ba48ac1-e8e8-4128-bc1a-221976e2b8c5" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">rightward shift</a> since its days under former Prime Minister Angela Merkel, the party calls for expanding international trade agreements, free-market policies and economic collaboration between Germany and France.</p>

    <p>“Politicians need to light the spark of self-confidence and openness for this country,” CDU Leader Friedrich Merz said during an interview with German research firm Fraunhofer, “The Germans have a highly developed sense of security. At some point, though, we must be prepared to take a leap into the unknown.”</p>

    <p>Germany’s most influential industries could stand to gain from Merz’s free-market policies. German automakers <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XETR-VOW/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">Volkswagen</a>, <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XETR-BMW/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">BMW</a> and <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XETR-MBG/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">Mercedes-Benz</a>, which collectively export roughly 75% of vehicles produced, could better compete on pricing internationally with lower tariffs and greater access to raw materials. The country’s budding renewable energy sector, which includes energy giants <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XETR-SIE/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">Siemens</a> and <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XETR-RWE/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">RWE Renewables</a>, could also see revenues spike as it fills the international demand for clean energy technology.</p>

    <p>With the U.S. likely to scale back its engagement in the global trade ecosystem under a Trump presidency, the CDU is well-positioned to expand trade relations with countries alienated by U.S. tariffs. While Merz and his party have already floated enhancing relations with France, they could also strengthen ties with China and Latin America, which have already <a href="https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/xw/zyxw/202411/t20241121_11530437.html" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">begun courting</a> Germany in recent weeks following Trump’s victory.</p>

    <p>Domestically, Merz has been vocal about his wish to deepen capital markets integration, namely through loosening regulations and simplifying cross-border investment. If implemented, the plan would allow German firms to unlock much-needed foreign capital, boosting share prices.</p>

    <p>“As soon as companies get big enough to really start producing, they need capital − so where do they turn? To the stock exchange in New York. That in itself is not an ideal situation,” Merz said.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the industry best positioned to benefit from new CDU leadership is Germany’s <a href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/german-military-nato/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">long-underfunded</a> defense sector. Merz and the CDU have long been staunch supporters of military support for Ukraine and Israel, arguing that Germany’s €4 trillion economy ($4.2 trillion) is “strong enough” to support a defense budget of €80 billion ($83.3 billion), 50% higher than Germany’s planned 2025 defense budget.</p>

    <p>“We are not in a phase of our history where we can lean back and do nothing,” Merz said during a press conference in February, “Our priorities have to be renewed, and priority number one is to keep the freedom of our people.”</p>

    <p>German defense company <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XETR-RHM/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">Rheinmetall</a>, which has seen shares spike 500% since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war, stands to benefit the greatest from military budget hikes. Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley recently <a href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/de:rhm/forecast" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">reiterated</a> buy ratings on the company’s stock, citing the likelihood that Rheinmetall will continue to snatch up multi-billion-euro defense contracts under a CDU-controlled parliament.</p>

    <p>A Merz policy sweep is not guaranteed of course. Polling numbers could change between now and February, and even if they don’t the CDU will have to form a coalition government with the Social Democratic Party, potentially requiring compromise on economic policy. However, if Merz can pass even a portion of his economic policy plans, it may be the spark German markets need to once again become a favorite among investors.</p>
