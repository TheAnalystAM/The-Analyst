    <div id="title">Dating app dysfunction - how Bumble stock plummeted 92% in three years</div>

    <p>Bumble (<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-BMBL/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">BMBL</a>) began its tenure on the NASDAQ with a bang, ending its first trading day up 63%.</p>

    <p>“We’re so honored and excited about this opportunity,” former Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Heard <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/bumble-ipo-bmbl-starts-trading-on-nasdaq.html" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">told CNBC</a> shortly before markets opened, “and we are really so excited about getting back to work and growing into our big future vision of connecting people across all verticals.”</p>

    <p>However, the stock quickly shed its post-IPO gains, and has since lost much more. Bumble has seen its shares plummet 92% over the past three years amid slowing user growth, declining total average revenue per paying user and ever-grimmer forecasts.</p>

    <p>Bumble’s earnings outlook only further darkened with the <a href="https://ir.bumble.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">release of its Q2 earnings</a> last Wednesday, with the company missing average analyst revenue estimates and slashing revenue outlooks. Annual growth is now expected between 1 and 2 percent from the previous year, compared to prior analyst expectations of 8.4%, per Bloomberg compiled estimates.</p>

    <p>Bumble shares plunged 32% in the day following the report’s release.</p>

    <p>The dating app’s steep decline in market share has largely been attributed to a slowdown in user growth post-pandemic as more people have opted to seek romantic partners in-person rather than online. This problem isn’t unique to Bumble, popular dating apps <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tinder-statistics/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">Tinder and Plenty of Fish</a> also experienced spikes and subsequent drawbacks in new subscribers as COVID-19 restrictions lifted.</p>

    <p>Shares of Match Group, the parent company of Tinder and Plenty of Fish, have fared better than Bumble stock, but not by much. Shares has shed nearly 75% of their value since early 2021.</p>

    <div id="photocredit">A comparison of Bumble and Match Group's three-year charts. Match Group stock experienced a nearly 75% decrease while Bumble stock declined 92%.</div>

    <p>The reason Bumble is faring worse than its competitors is its business model, which generally relies on men buying premium subscriptions for a dating app that makes it difficult for them to reap the benefits of their subscriptions.</p>

    <p>Bumble was founded in 2014 by former CEO Whitney Wolfe Heard to reform the “outdated dynamic” of dating in which men are expected to make the first move. When two users match on Bumble, the woman is the only one able to send the first message, which can be done in the first 24 hours of matching before the connection is permanently deleted.</p>

    <p>Despite the dating app’s female-centric system, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/975984/us-bumble-user-ratio-gender/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">67% of the app’s monthly active users</a> are male, and while Bumble doesn’t release demographic statistics for its paid subscribers, a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/02/02/the-who-where-and-why-of-online-dating-in-the-u-s/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">2022 report</a> by the Pew Research Center found men are much more likely to pay for dating app subscriptions than women.</p>

    <p>While a male-heavy subscriber base has worked well for more traditional dating apps, where men pay to connect and chat with more women, it has limited Bumble’s subscription revenue growth. Even if male users sign up for Bumble Premium and match with more women, there is no guarantee they will have more conversations with female users who may ultimately decide not to send a first message, making a Bumble subscription less appealing.</p>

    <p>Looking forward, Bumble hopes to diversify its revenue streams to lessen the company’s reliance on lagging premium subscriptions.</p>

    <p>“We're trading unsustainable short-term growth in favor of better connecting customer experiences with long-term growth potential,” CEO Lidiane Jones told investors in the company’s earnings call last week, “We will also lean on areas of strength and where we see growth opportunities, including Badoo, international expansion and adjacent opportunities like advertising.”</p>

    <p>Badoo, which was founded in 2006 and merged with Bumble in 2021, is available in 190 countries and 47 languages, making it one of the most <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-2e3f0042-75f6-4bd1-b4fe-9056540c65f8" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">widely used</a> global dating apps. While the app has had <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/dating-app-market/#:~:text=Badoo%20is%20the%20most%20downloaded,with%20executives%2C%20to%20found%20Bumble" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">difficulty breaking into</a> U.S. markets, growing the app’s international presence is one way Bumble hopes to further expand into global markets.</p>

    <p>Currently, Wall Street is on the fence whether Bumble can achieve revenue diversification, with 64% of analysts assigning a hold rating to the stock, per CNN compiled analyses. For now, it's likely best to wait and see if Bumble can pull off the turnaround it needs to bring investors back.</p>
