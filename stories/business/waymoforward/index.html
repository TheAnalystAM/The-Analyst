    <p>When the news landed on her phone, Hayley Au-Yang said she scrambled to grab her laptop.</p>

    <p>The USC sophomore raced to secure her spot on the Waymo waitlist after the company announced it was bringing its popular autonomous rideshare service to Los Angeles.</p>

    <p>“I saw on my feed that they [Waymo] were only accepting so many waitlist applicants to test ride their cars,” said Au-Yang. “I’ve wanted to try an autonomous taxi ride for so long so I was excited by the test-driving opportunity.”</p>

    <p>Au-Yang is not the only one jumping at the chance to try Los Angeles’ new self-driving rideshare service. As of March 2024, Waymo has <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2024/03/scaling-waymo-one-safely-across-four-cities-this-year/">reported</a> over 15,000 autonomous rides taken by passengers in Santa Monica, Century City, Mid City, K-Town and Downtown LA.</p>

    <p>Autonomous vehicle (AV) rideshare services are available from Santa Monica to Downtown thanks to a March <a href="https://nationalcenterformobilitymanagement.org/news/california-gives-waymo-the-green-light-to-start-charging-for-rides-in-la/">decision</a> by rideshare regulators at the California Public Utilities Commission. In a March 1 vote, the group allowed Waymo to operate in Los Angeles, stating in an open <a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/-/media/cpuc-website/divisions/consumer-protection-and-enforcement-division/documents/tlab/av-programs/waymo-al-2-disposition-letter-20240301_signed.pdf">letter</a> Waymo has “complied with” all safety requirements necessary for expansion.  The move comes after months of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/autonomous-vehicles-in-la-bring-out-protesters-concerned-with-safety-and-job-loss/">protests</a> in Los Angeles and San Francisco denouncing the technology as a dangerous tool slated to destroy <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/how-ubers-autonomous-cars-will-destroy-10-million-jobs-and-reshape-the-economy-by-2025-lyft-google-zack-kanter/">millions</a> of jobs.</p>

    <p>Many experts, such as USC computer science professor Cyrus Shahabi, said the California autonomous rideshare industry’s “greatest hurdle” going forward will not be protests, but government regulation. Shahabi fears expanding rideshare services could “face the same fate as Cruise,” which <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gms-cruise-halts-self-driving-operations-regulator-safety-fears/">suspended</a> operations after one of its cars hit and dragged a San Francisco pedestrian, leading to the revocation of the company’s license to operate in the city.</p>

    <p>“If California cracks down hard on autonomous taxi service companies before they really get off the ground, it's going to be hard for investors to justify funneling more money into an unprofitable venture,” said Shahabi. “We’ll probably see more companies like Cruise halt operations and the industry falter.”</p>

    <p>Waymo, formerly known as the Google Self-Driving Car Project, was founded in 2009 as Google sought to develop autonomous vehicles. The company first offered commercial AV rideshare services in 2020 to San Francisco riders, and has since <a href="https://ktar.com/story/5556418/waymo-to-start-testing-rider-only-vehicles-on-phoenix-area-freeways/">expanded</a> operations to serve the Phoenix metropolitan area, Los Angeles and Austin.</p>

    <p>While not cheap, Waymo rides are relatively cost competitive with traditional Uber and Lyft rideshare services, with Waymo charging on average $7.60 for a 15-minute (about 3 miles) ride compared to Uber and Lyft’s $7.20.</p>

    <img src="/img/waymosf.jpg" id="bodyphoto">

    <p>Despite Waymo’s swift expansion, with the company now operating across <a href="https://waymo.com/waymo-one-los-angeles/">63 square miles</a> of Los Angeles between Santa Monica and Downtown, it faces stiff competition from rivals. Motional, Lyft’s AV rideshare venture, currently operates in Pittsburgh, Singapore, Las Vegas and Los Angeles, while Uber AV offers rides in Phoenix and Las Vegas.</p>

    <p>Expanding AV rideshare companies may not be the only ones that suffer from strict California autonomous vehicle regulations. USC Systems Engineering Professor Emeritus James Moore said the state could suffer too if overregulation “frightens off” autonomous taxi companies.</p>

    <p>“The state [California] is setting itself up for failure if it goes down its current path of overregulating and frankly antagonizing the self-driving ridesharing industry,” said Moore. “Auto companies will move operations to more conservative, business-friendly states, leaving California to foot the bill in lost taxes.”</p>

    <p>However, not all experts believe California’s strict autonomous rideshare regulations will be harmful. Many experts pointed out that regulation may be the only way to mitigate the mass unemployment that could be wrought by a swift expansion of autonomous taxi services.</p>

    <p>According to a 2017 study conducted by the Center for Global Policy Solutions, over 4 million rideshare gig workers nationwide could be put out of work with the rollout of AV rideshare services. While 20,000 of these potentially unemployed are <a href="https://www.drivers-united.org/about-us">represented</a> by California’s growing political heavyweight union, Rideshare Drivers United — which in a statement vowed to “protect the livelihoods of our union drivers at all costs,” — it ultimately rests on government regulators to slow AV rideshare expansion and allow drivers time to find new work.</p>

    <p>Strict regulation could also improve the safety records and reputations of AV rideshare services by forcing companies to “significantly slow down,” according to USC Industrial Engineering Professor Maged Dessouky.</p>

    <p>“Waymo was really born surrounded by the Silicon Valley ethos that success requires you to move fast and break things,’” said Dessouky. “However, when you are toying with the safety of drivers and pedestrians, caution will serve you a lot better than speed, especially if you’re trying to avoid bad PR.”</p>

    <p>When asked for comment, the California Department of Motor Vehicles, which regulates the distribution of operating permits to AV rideshare companies, said public safety is “the California DMV’s top priority.” </p>

    <p>“When weighing regulatory action, we are constantly striving to ensure the safe operation of autonomous vehicles and safety of the public who share the road with these vehicles,” said DMV Public Information Officer Chris Orrock.</p>

    <p>No matter experts’ stance on California AV rideshare regulatory policy, most agreed state regulation has so far failed to keep up with the industry’s rapid growth. Dessouky and Shahabi both said increased investment in California transportation regulatory bodies, including the state DMV and the California Public Utilities Commission, was necessary to ensure a safe rollout of AV rideshare services.</p>

    <p>By far the greatest stakeholders in AV rideshare expansion, the general public, hold mixed views of the budding industry. According to a 2024 survey conducted by car insurance company The Zebra, 53% of the survey's 2,000 respondents said they would feel safer taking a self-driving taxi than a driver-operated rideshare alone. Additionally, Gen Z respondents were the most open to rideshares, with 40% saying they would take a ride in an AV taxi.</p>

    <p>In Los Angeles, public sentiments towards AV rideshare services generally track national perceptions. USC Senior Emily Lee, who first rode in an LA Waymo taxi in mid-March and has ridden multiple times since, said that while AV taxis have a long way to go before mass deployment, these services solve critical issues found in traditional rideshare services.</p>

    <p>“I think when I get into an Uber, I’m always concerned about how safely the driver will drive since my fate is out of my control,” said Lee. “But when I take a Waymo I know the driving system and I know the many tests it's been through, and so I know I’m in good hands.”</p>

    <p>Self-driving taxis may also help address a growing <a href="https://helpingsurvivors.org/rideshare-sexual-assault/statistics/">problem</a> with ridesharing: sexual violence wrought by drivers. Without a driver present, USC junior computer science student Amanda, who asked only her first name be used given the sensitive nature of the topic, said the fear of sexual assault “completely disappears” and has allowed her to “fully relax” during rides.</p>

    <p>Still, other residents fear Los Angeles could become the next San Francisco, a city racked with anger and fear after experiencing multiple high-profile incidents of AV taxis hitting pedestrians.</p>

    <p>“I just don’t think the technology works,” said South Central LA resident Lamar Porter. “All hell broke loose in San Francisco when they started driving autonomous taxis around, and I don’t think any of those issues were fixed before the cars started being allowed on our streets.”</p>

    <p>Waymo Product Marketing Manager Julianne McGoldrick, who is on the team responsible for overseeing the rollout of Waymo’s Los Angeles AV taxi services, said the company is “fully aware of” the public’s concerns about the safety of their vehicles.

    <p>“We here at Waymo place safety as the number one consideration whenever we decide how best to alter or expand our Los Angeles services,” said McGoldrick. “What I will say is report after report shows our vehicles are safer than human-driven cars. While we still have much work to do, we have come a long way safety-wise, and I think that will show up on LA roadways.”</p>

    <p>A 2023 <a href="https://www.swissre.com/reinsurance/property-and-casualty/solutions/automotive-solutions/study-autonomous-vehicles-safety-collaboration-with-waymo.html">report</a> conducted by Waymo and insurance giant Swiss Re, which analyzed insurance liability claims to determine the number of collisions Waymo AVs and human-driven vehicles experienced in a year, found that Waymo AVs resulted in 76% fewer accidents involving property damage than human-driven vehicles. Collision data involving pedestrians, however, is much harder to collect and quantify.</p>

    <p>Despite regulatory, safety and union challenges, experts and Waymo are optimistic about the future of the AV rideshare industry, citing increased roadway safety, decreased rideshare <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/technology/unlocking-the-social-and-economic-benefits-of-autonomous-vehicles">costs</a> for consumers and the creation of high-paying, white-collar <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/10/autonomous-vehicles-are-creating-jobs-heres-where.html">jobs</a>.</p>

    <p>“Whatever challenges come our way, we’ll deal with them in stride,” said McGoldrick. “The path forward is rocky because we’re really the first movers in the industry, but there is no doubt in our minds that autonomous vehicles and our work is part of a better future.”</p>
