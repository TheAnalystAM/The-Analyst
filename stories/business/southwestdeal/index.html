    <div id="bodytext">
      
    <p><a href="https://www.elliottmgmt.com/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">Elliot Investment Management</a> and Southwest Airlines (<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-LUV/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">LUV</a>) have entered settlement discussions in a bid to stave off a proxy battle over control of the airline’s board, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>

    <p>The hedge fund is seeking a deal that would give them representation on Southwest’s board, but not control. The board will decrease to 12 members after <a href="https://skift.com/2024/09/10/southwest-chairman-gary-kelly-to-step-down-amid-activist-pressure/#:~:text=Southwest%20Airlines%20chairman%20Gary%20Kelly,leave%20the%20board%20in%20November" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">Chairman Gary Kelly steps down</a> next year, meaning Elliot will likely receive fewer than six selections.</p>

    <p>The talks, which progressed through Saturday, are preliminary and could fall through, sources say. While Southwest has previously offered Elliot <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/southwest-chairman-gary-kelly-retire-after-2025-annual-meeting-2024-09-10/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">some concessions</a>, until now the airline has refused to discuss leadership changes.</p>

    <p>On Monday, Elliot Management called for a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/elliott-requests-special-meeting-with-southwest-airlines-bloomberg-news-reports-2024-10-14/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">special shareholder meeting</a> on Dec. 10. The fund said it hoped to replace eight chairmen and take command of the airline’s board.</p>

    </p>Southwest responded by saying it had attempted to contact Elliot Management in the hopes of avoiding a fight. The airline stated the shareholder meeting was scheduled to cause “maximum disruption” before a busy travel season.</p>

    <p>Elliot Management, which is one of Wall Street's <a href="https://qz.com/elliott-investment-history-activist-investor-hedge-fund-1851627755#:~:text=FactSet%20has%20designated%20Elliott%20a,different%20companies%2C%20according%20to%20FactSet" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">biggest and busiest</a> activist investors, surprised shareholders when it <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/elliott-management-reportedly-takes-11-135834754.html#:~:text=Elliott%20Management%20has%20taken%20an,to%20meet%20on%20September%209" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">took an 11% stake</a> in the Dallas-based airline in June. Since then, the hedge fund has fought a <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-news-travel/southwest-airlines-battle-activist-investor-heats-up-free-bags-chopping-block" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">highly publicized battle</a> to remove board members, fire CEO Bob Jordan and review the company’s financial strategies in an effort to boost the company’s financial performance.</p>

    <p>Shares of Southwest are down nearly 47% since the COVID pandemic began back in March of 2020.</p>

    <p>Southwest stock surged after an investor event last month in which the company laid out a 3-year plan that Jordan claimed would add $4 billion in earnings before interest and taxes by 2027.</p>

    <p>The proposal, which marked the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/09/26/southwest-airlines-free-bags-assigned-seating/">biggest change to Southwest's operating structure</a> in 50 years, included partnerships, vacation packages for customers and aircraft sale-leasebacks. In response to shifting consumer preferences, the airline decided to end Southwest’s longstanding open-seating policy and planned to add extra legroom seats to flights.</p>

    <p>Elliot remained unimpressed by the changes, stating the plan was “filled with long-dated promises of better performance.”</p>

    <p>The hedge fund has been particularly insistent on its calls to oust Jordan from his post, who they accused of “playing with shareholders’ money.”</p>

    <p>“We believe that competent new leaders, working through a deliberate and thoughtful process, should chart the course forward for Southwest,” Elliott partner John Pike and portfolio manager Bobby Xu said on Monday in a letter to shareholders.</p>

    <p>Southwest has so far stood behind Jordan, who has been at the airline for more than four decades. His goal was to increase airline revenues and better compete against competitors.</p>

    <p>Southwest reports third-quarter results on Thursday. The company raised its Q3 revenue forecast late last month.</p>
