    <div id="title">NIH to slash billions of medical research funding for indirect research costs</div>

    <div id="bodytext">
      
    <p>The National Institute of Health announced Friday that it would cut an estimated $4 billion in research funding for indirect costs, a move some researchers say will stifle scientific advancement.</p>

    <p>According to an agency memo, indirect research funding, which typically covers administrative and building costs, will be set at a standard rate of 15% for all grant recipients. Awardees have on average allocated 27% to 28% of funding for indirect costs.</p>

    <p>The changes will go into effect on Monday. They come just two weeks after President Trump appointed Dr. Matthew Memoli as acting director of the NIH.</p>

    <p>“The United States should have the best medical research in the world.” The NIH said in its announcement. “It is accordingly vital to ensure that as many funds as possible go towards direct scientific research costs rather than administrative overhead.”</p>

    <p>Newer research organizations are likely to suffer the most given they often lack the scale to minimize overhead costs. Smaller labs have earmarked as much as 60% toward administrative, building, utilities and depreciation costs.</p>

    <p>Some researchers believe that higher overhead costs could reduce the number of public and private lab ventures, crippling the research pipeline crucial for scientific breakthroughs.</p>

    <p>Anusha Kalbasi, a lead radiation oncologist at Stanford University, which receives the grants, said the grants help “keep the lights on and ventilation flowing in our labs, keep us safe from biohazards, maintain the infrastructure for massive amounts of data, and employ the staff that help researchers focus on science.”</p>

    <div id="photocredit">A post from the NIH's official X account detailing estimated savings under the new overhead funding structure.</div>

    <p>The nation’s largest private research organizations, including the Gates Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation of New York, could see minimal disruption, with many recording indirect between 10% and 15%.</p>

    <p>Elon Musk, who since Trump’s swearing-in has led the Department of Government Efficiency in <a href="https://time.com/7213149/cutting-costs-wont-make-government-efficient/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">slashing hundreds of billions of dollars in government spending</a>, was quick to voice his opinion on the matter.</p>

    <p>“Can you believe that universities with tens of billions in endowments were siphoning off 60% of research award money for ‘overhead’?” Musk wrote on X. “What a ripoff!”

    <p>The suggestion to limit indirect research grant funding was included in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c977njnvq2do" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">Project 2025’s wishlist for a second Trump administration</a>. Many of the Project’s architects, including head author Russell Vought, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/russ-vought-tapped-cfpbs-acting-director-directs-bureau-issue-no-new-rules-stop-new-investigations" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">have been tapped to fill Trump administration positions.</a></p>

    <p>Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/08/nih-cuts-billions-dollars-biomedical-funding-effective-immediately/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">told the Washington Post</a> that some labs had already begun shutting down over the weekend in light of the news.</p>

    <p>Mitchell said groups were preparing to file a lawsuit aimed at the cuts on Monday.</p>

    <p>“This is a surefire way to cripple lifesaving research and innovation,” the Council of Governmental Relations, which tracks federal policy for major universities and medical research centers, said in a statement. “America’s competitors will relish this self-inflicted wound. We urge NIH to rescind this dangerous policy before its harms are felt by Americans.”</p>
