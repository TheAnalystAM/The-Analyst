    <p>The fight against cancer is rapidly advancing thanks to the development of new vaccines that train patients' immune systems to identify and attack cancerous tumors.</p>


    <p>Highly individualized treatments developed by the likes of Merck and Moderna, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrolizumab" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">Pembrolizumab</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA-4157/V940" target="_blank">mRNA-4157/V940</a> and <a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/research/integrative-research/cancer-vaccines/neovax" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">NeoVAX</a>, are showing promising results in clinical trials. Combined with new genetic testing methods, cancer treatment is taking on a more individualized approach based on patients’ unique genetic profiles.</p>

    <p>If progress maintains its current pace, many experts believe that cancer could soon be far less deadly.</p>

    <p>Cancer mRNA vaccines are modeled off the COVID-19 vaccines pioneered during the pandemic. When applied, the mRNA vaccine mimics natural cell membranes and enables <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocytosis" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">endocytosis</a>, delivering the messenger RNA to the tumor. The mRNA then encodes <a href="https://www.lidebiotech.com/blog/cancer-antigens-everything-you-need-know" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">antigen proteins</a> that are unique to the patient’s cancer cells. These antigens serve as blueprints to train the immune system to recognize developing cancer tumors and provoke a targeted immune response that eliminates cancer cells.</p>

    <p>Unlike current cancer treatments such as radiation therapy and chemotherapy, which often harm healthy cells, mRNA vaccines are designed to specifically target cancerous cells, reducing damage to the rest of the body while minimizing side effects.</p>

    <p>Crucially, mRNA cancer vaccines differ from traditional vaccines in that they are not preventive. Rather than protecting healthy individuals from getting cancer, these vaccines are designed to attack existing tumors in patients who have already been diagnosed.</p>

    <p>Currently, the major players in this growing field are Moderna and Merck. The two pharmaceutical behemoths are responsible for developing the most well-researched and recognized mRNA cancer vaccines to date, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrolizumab" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">Pembrolizumab</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA-4157/V940" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">mRNA-4157/V940</a>. Meanwhile, nonprofit organizations institutions like the Dana‑Farber Cancer Institute are developing targeted mRNA vaccines focused on treating less common types of cancer.</p>

    <p>While many are still undergoing trial phases, some mRNA cancer vaccines are already being deployed in personalized immunotherapy treatment.</p>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrolizumab" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">Pembrolizumab</a> has the widest use, helping to prevent or delay cancer recurrence and <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/metastasis" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">metastasis</a>. The treatment has already <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/new-immunotherapy-treatment-head-neck-cancers-vnx979f0g#:~:text=Head%20and%20neck%20cancer%20patients,was%20added%20to%20their%20treatment." target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">boosted survival rates</a> among patients with skin, bowel, lung, brain and pancreatic cancer.</p>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA-4157/V940" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">mRNA-4157/V940</a> and <a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/research/integrative-research/cancer-vaccines/neovax" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">NeoVAX</a>, while also broadly applicable, are customized for specific cancer types through genetic testing and tailored antigen production. These vaccines are typically administered after surgery as postoperational therapies for melanoma, bladder cancer and other <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5849393/" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">high-mutation-rate</a>.</p>

    <p>Cancer vaccine results have so far been promising.</p>

    <p>In clinical trials, head and neck cancer patients <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40532178/" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">lived twice as long</a> after immunotherapy. Former cancer <a href="https://www.drugs.com/medical-answers/type-cancer-pembrolizumab-3553698/" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">patients</a> treated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrolizumab" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">Pembrolizumab</a> remained cancer-free for 52 months, compared to 30 months with standard care. Three years post-treatment, patients who received immunotherapy along with surgery had a 10 percent lower risk of cancer returning elsewhere in the body. In high-risk melanoma patients, a combination of mRNA vaccines and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrolizumab" target="_blank" style="color: #4169e1;">Pembrolizumab</a> revealed a 44 percent reduction in the relative risk of recurrence or death. These are stunning outcomes, underscoring the immense potential of mRNA-based treatments to reshape cancer therapy globally.</p>

    <p>Cancer vaccines are poised to permanently change how we understand, treat and survive cancer. As these therapies move out of clinical trials and into broader use, they hold the promise of saving millions from what is now often considered a death sentence. Their development represents perhaps one of the most important steps in the fight to end cancer.</p>
