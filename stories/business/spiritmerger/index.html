    <div id="bodytext">
      
    <p>In 2010, the mergers and acquisitions regulation equivalent of an all-out financial meltdown occurred: the merger between Live Nation, an events promoter and venue operator, and Ticketmaster, our beloved ticket sales behemoth was completed without resistance from the Justice Department, then under the Obama administration.</p>

    <p>How bad was the merger on consumers? The united Live Nation, Ticketmaster Goliath now controls 70% of the ticketing and live events venues market, allowing them to put a stranglehold on performers and musicgoers alike. If you have tried to buy a ticket on Ticketmaster’s website to see your favorite artists perform anytime in the last decade, you probably know the pain of this consolidated market well. High “transaction” fees have become the norm, as Ticketmaster sucks in cash with each ticket sale and watches its revenue soar through the roof.</p>

    <p>However, The Department of Justice (DOJ) doesn’t easily forget its mistakes.</p>

    <p>“Frankly, [The DOJ] is probably still feeling a little bit of a sting from letting Live Nation and Ticketmaster go through,” said USC Business Professor Kyle Mayer. “It's interesting to see now after Live Nation how the DOJ looks at their job and what the criteria should be for blocking mergers and acquisitions.”</p>

    <p>Interesting, indeed. Since the Ticketmaster fiasco, the Justice Department has grown fangs. The department has blocked monumental mergers in the name of protecting competition in markets. Deals between publishing houses Penguin Random House and Bertelsmann, CVS Health, and Health Insurance Provide Aetna, all met their demise under the precise blade of the Justice Department. The DOJ also almost blocked a proposed merger between Microsoft, the creator of the much-adored Xbox video game console, and video game creator Activision Blizzard.</p>

    <p>Despite its many recent successes, The Justice Department has only just started its crusade against domineering companies. Along with the federal government’s other enforcer of competitive practices, the Federal Trade Commission, the two federal branches have finalized new guidelines around their enforcement of mergers and acquisitions activity that is being called the strictest antitrust playbook adopted by the two organizations in decades.</p>

    <p>The Justice Department truly seems to finally be coming into its own, true Robinhoods protecting the average U.S. consumer from the big bad mega-corporations. This view of antitrust is too black and white, however, too simple to fully encapsulate the complexities of mergers and acquisitions and their impact on market dynamics. However, the Biden Department of Justice has embraced this view of antitrust enforcement hook, line, and sinker, leaving no room for mergers residing in a gray area that has significant potential to bolster competition.</p>

    <p>No one has felt the pain of the DOJ’s new enforcement pattern like executives at Jetblue and Spirit Airlines. Only a few weeks ago, a proposed merger between Spirit Airlines and Jetblue Airlines that had been challenged by the Justice Department was blocked by a federal judge. The reason?</p>

    <p>"The government has demonstrated that consumers value Spirit flights as a unique, economical product option," U.S. District Judge William Young wrote in his ruling. "The removal of Spirit as an option for consumers, therefore, would constitute a cognizable harm."</p>

    <p>Yes, losing Spirit Airlines would be tragic. As much as the airline is laughed at, it is a great choice for budget flyers looking for an al-a-carte flying experience. However, the existence of Spirit Airlines as a separate entity and flying choice is drastically detrimental to one party involved in all this: Spirit Airlines.</p>

    <p>The company is facing a financial whirlwind. The company is dealing with a double threat of slim profit margins combined with a stunningly large amount of leases and debts it has to pay off that were taken out during its meteoric growth period. The company has bled through cash in the last three of five quarters and is looking to refinance its debt in 2025. Safe to say, the skies aren’t going to clear for Spirit anytime soon.</p>

    <p>With Spirit grounded financially, a merger between Spirit and Jetblue could have been just what the company needed to survive, to possibly live on as a budget flying option under a cash-flushed Jetblue.</p>

    <p>However, even ignoring Spirit’s abysmal financials, a merger with Jetblue could have introduced competition to a historically anticompetitive airline industry.</p>

    <p>Four “legacy” airlines, Delta, United, Southwest, and American, control 70% of all domestic flights within the U.S.. These airlines have gobbled up a combined 42 smaller airlines to become industry titans each in their own right. This consolidation is terrible for consumers as it has led to an increase in ticket prices, a marked drop in flight quality experience and less timely plane arrivals.</p>

    <p>A Spirit Airlines, Jetblue merger could have fixed this. A merger could have created a much stronger Jetblue holding an 11% market share, on par with United Airlines, rather than a measly 6%. A Spirit, Jetblue deal could have turned the Big Four into the Big Five, and all U.S. domestic flyers could have experienced the benefits of increased airline competition.</p>

    <p>Instead, the Justice Department and the courts held a black-and-white view of what constitutes a good, competitive merger versus a bad, anticompetitive merger, leaving consumers stuck with a crumbling Spirit Airlines, a budget choice only for so long as it exists, and a persisting consolidated airline industry.</p>

    <p>The point the Justice Department missed is that not all mergers in already consolidated industries are bad. Just like a beanstalk in a garden needs a trellis to climb up, grow upon, and compete with larger plants for sunlight, smaller companies in consolidated industries need mergers to boost themselves to the operational size of legacy industry titans and properly compete. If the Justice Department keeps kneecapping smaller merging companies like Jetblue and Spirit, smaller companies will remain options for travelers, but will never achieve the economy of scale required to be as competitive an option as industry titans. If these companies aren’t competitive options, then legacy industry giants have no reason to compete and upset the status quo.</p>

    <p>I am not advocating for the Justice Department to return to its 2000s and early 2010s freewheeling, pro-business, asleep-at-the-wheel self. However, the Department of Justice must be careful not to move the dial too far in the opposite direction and become too stringent when policing mergers. A radical shift towards over-enforcement will only lead to more gray-area mergers like the Jetblue and Spirit deal falling between the cracks, deals that could have momentously improved industry competition but instead are labeled wholly bad without asterisks and shipped off with haste to the executioner.</p>

    <p>In the post-inflation economic boom year that is to come, it is more important than ever for the Justice Department to get it right. As the number of proposed mergers skyrockets in step with good economic fortune, the department must make sure it can properly sort through each deal, understand rather than dismiss gray area deals, and make sure no merger falls between the cracks.</p>
