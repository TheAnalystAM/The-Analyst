    <div id="bodytext">
      
    <p>Comcast (<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-CMCSA/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">CMCSA</a>) <a href="https://www.cmcsa.com/events-and-presentations" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">announced</a> in its earnings call today it was considering spinning off NBC Universal’s Cable Networks.</p>

    <p>“We are now exploring whether creating a new well-capitalized company, owned by our shareholders and comprised of our strong portfolio of cable networks, would position them to take advantage of opportunities in the changing media landscape and create value for our shareholders,” Comcast President Mike Cavanagh said during the call. “We are not ready to talk about any specifics yet, but we’ll be back to you as and when we reach firm conclusions.” </p>

    <p>At a glance, the plan makes perfect sense. Comcast’s cable networks, including Bravo, E!, Syfy, Oxygen True Crime, USA Networks, MSNBC and CNBC, are not growing anymore as millions of consumers cut the cord each year. They represent declining assets that have strained the legacy media company’s balance sheets, warding off investors.</p>

    <p>Without the burden of cable, Comcast could finally transform its corporate image. Instead of trading at the 10 to 15 times earnings ratio typical among legacy media, Comcast could potentially trade at 30 to 40 times earnings, rates reserved for hybrid tech and media behemoths such as Netflix.</p>

    <p>Without the burden of cable, investors can no longer define Comcast. Is it a media company, a tech stock or a film production group? The better Comcast can cast the shadow of ambiguity over itself, the better the stock will perform in a landscape where ambiguity often equates to possibility.</p>

    <p>A cable spin-off seems like a great solution to a dire issue, so why hesitate? Surely other legacy media companies have already thought about such a solution and are eager to incorporate such grandiose plans.</p>

    <p>While legacy media executives have considered divesting cable assets, with Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger going so far as to announce such a plan last year, they all eventually came to the same conclusion; a cable media spin-off would be a big mistake. Iger <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/disney-ceo-bob-iger-linear-tv-fx-emmys-the-bear-shogun-1236046156/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">backtracked</a> on the strategy less than a year after his announcement while Comcast competitors Warner Bros. and Paramount Global have remained radio silent.</p>

    <p>The conclusion that most hardened media executives have come to is that while restructuring sounds amazing to investors itching for growth after years of stagnation, the implications of such a transition make the strategy seem less like a miracle cure and more like a self-sabotaging flop.</p>

    <p>The primary issue with a cable divestiture is determining how to fill the gaping content hole left by cable media’s exit. Contrary to its name, cable media does not solely produce content for cable. Comcast’s darling streaming service, Peacock, benefits greatly from the linear TV shows, documentaries and news released to the streaming platform within a day of their airing.</p>

    <img src="/img/comcastcabletwo.jpg" id="bodyphoto">

    <p>Without on-demand cable content to fill its media library, Peacock will surely jettison subscribers. At a time when Comcast is <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/business/money-report/heres-what-to-know-before-comcast-reports-third-quarter-earnings/3548708/?os=Fpn4c7ikwkiNAAg&ref=app#:~:text=Peacock%20also%20enjoyed%20a%20boost,up%2082%25%20to%20%241.5%20billion" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">celebrating</a> the streaming service’s progressive march to profitability, such sudden subscriber churn would undoubtedly sour streaming growth forecasts, which has been a rare bright spot among otherwise dour earnings figures.</p>

    <p>Let’s say, for the sake of argument, that Comcast was able to shore up its content deficit using the money gained from its cable firesale. Even with Peacock safe from harm, who is going to buy Comcast’s cable division? Declining assets have proven to be toxic waste to shareholders. Which organization would want to deal with the investor blowback from such a sure-to-be unpopular acquisition?</p>

    <p>Starz, which is set to part ways with parent company Lionsgate by the end of 2024, has floated the idea of leading the charge on a cable media rollup, which would see linear TV organizations large and small be consolidated into one sustainable conglomerate. However, the Santa Monica-based media company, for all its grand ambitions, is a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/internet/streaming-stats/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">relatively minuscule player</a> in the media landscape and is unlikely able to cough up the funds necessary to get a massive project like this off the ground.</p>

    <p>The only buyer with enough capital and business know-how to pick up Comcast’s cable division is private equity. The appetite is certainly there, as seen in Apollo Global Management's (<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-APO/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">APO</a>) <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/apollo-global-11-billion-paramount-pictures-acquisition-1235947523/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">last-minute bid</a> to try and acquire Paramount Pictures in March. The purchase would have added to an already extensive list of media-related <a href="https://www.apollo.com/insights-news/pressreleases/2021/09/apollo-funds-complete-acquisition-of-yahoo-161530593" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">investments</a> the firm has made in recent years.</p>

    <p>The issue is that private equity firms like Apollo have a nasty habit of gutting the media organizations they work so hard to acquire. For proof of this, you need look no further than the local news industry, which has been devastated by a <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/study-private-equity-firms-buying-newspapers-cut-local-news/" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">litany</a> of PE acquisitions. In today’s hyper-competitive media landscape, it is unlikely a gutted Comcast cable company could compete, let alone survive, when up against media behemoths still fully vested in their cable operations.</p>

    <p>No, the best path forward for Comcast is much more complicated yet more rewarding if properly executed. For now, Comcast should continue funding its cable operation, which still brings in billions of dollars despite rampant cable cutting. As the linear TV industry continues to fade, the organization should focus on smoothly transitioning live television to Peacock, allowing subscribers to continue satiating their desire for live TV, just on a different platform.</p>

    <p>It makes sense that Comcast is considering such drastic measures to rid itself of its declining cable empire. When there’s a fire in your home, you usually make for the closest exit. However, if cooler heads prevail, Comcast will be able to use its cable content to boost Peacock, pushing the fledgling streaming service much closer to its profitability goals.</p>
