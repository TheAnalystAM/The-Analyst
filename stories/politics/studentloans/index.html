    <p>Trump has a long history of failed business gambles that include running two casinos, three hotels and a university into the ground, and now his failure has moved squarely into the public sector.</p>

    <p>Last month, his administration executed one of the most drastic government agency purges in recent history, firing over a third of the agency’s 4,133 person <a href="[https://www.npr.org/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5325854/trump-education-department-layoffs-civil-rights-student-loans]" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">staff</a>. The cut, which was enacted with little justification, will unravel key federal student aid programs and delay crucial services, irreparably harming a cornerstone of America’s economic and social infrastructure.</p>

    <p>At a time when I and a record 42 million Americans are carrying federal student loans, a significant part of the Department’s core responsibilities—student loan servicing, borrower protections and aid distribution—have never been more essential.</p>

    <p>Despite this, the Trump administration has moved the student debt portfolio out of the Education Department entirely. Responsibility now rests in the hands of the Small Business Administration (SBA), itself a victim of cost cutting measures that saw <a href="[https://www.sba.gov/article/2025/03/21/small-business-administration-announces-agency-wide-reorganization]" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">43% of its staff fired</a>last month. The remaining SBA staff are not trained nor equipped to manage the <a href="[https://www.statista.com/statistics/500814/debt-owned-by-consumers-usa-by-type/]" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">second-largest debt portfolio</a>debt portfolio in the country, especially in the wake of such steep internal reductions. This move will only contribute to Trump's chaotic saga of managerial inadequacies by creating delayed payments and frozen forgiveness programs that leave millions of borrowers in the dark.</p>

    <p>We’ve recently seen how disastrously poor planning can derail federal loan awardment and disbursement. The 2024-25 FAFSA rollout saw technical errors and poor planning that left many students in limbo for months, and new strains on the system threatens to push it into total collapse. Already, loan forgiveness efforts under the Biden-era SAVE plan are <a href="[https://studentaid.gov]" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">indefinitely paused</a>, and this won’t be the only program that’ll be derailed. Trump’s game here clearly isn't simple policy whiplash, it’s active sabotage.</p>

    <p>While executive actions can reshape our administrative state, Trump knows only Congress has the constitutional authority to eliminate entire departments. Yet that fact hasn't stopped his administration from effectively attempting to shutter the Department of Education from the inside out. Seven of the 12 civil rights offices within the Department, which are responsible for investigating discrimination complaints and enforcing Title IX protections, have shuttered their doors in compliance with <a href="[https://www.k12dive.com/news/half-of-ocr-fired-after-trump-education-department-layoffs/742374/]" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">Trump’s executive orders</a>. The legal gray zone here is striking, but the human cost is clearer: students across the country will lose options in the face of Trump’s intentional injustice.</p>

    <p>Higher education institutions are also under siege. In recent weeks, the Trump administration has made hundreds of billions of dollars of federal funding for universities contingent upon ideological compliance with his demands. Harvard University was threatened with the revocation of <a href="[https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-reviewing-federal-contracts-grants-harvard-over-antisemitism-allegations-2025-03-31/]" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">$9 billion</a>in federal funding if it did not comply with administration demands to rectify alleged pro-Hamas antisemitism in response to last spring’s student-led protests against the ongoing Israel-Hamas War, and Trump has subsequently <a href="[https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05768jmm11o]" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">blocked</a>Harvard’s ability to enroll international students because of the university’s legal pushback. At Columbia, a similar ultimatum led to sweeping changes. The university agreed to overhaul its Middle Eastern Studies Department and revise protest and security policies in the hopes of clawing back <a href="[https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/nyregion/columbia-response-trump-demands.html]" style="color: #4169e1;" target="_blank">$400 million in federal funding</a>.</p>

    <p>The Trump administration’s moves signal a new kind of government overreach in the United States, one where academic freedoms are traded for political loyalty. If universities stand to lose billions for not aligning with the executive branch’s worldview, what room is left for intellectual freedom, critical thought or student activism? None, apparently.</p>

    <p>Let me be clear, this is not about efficiency or budget tightening for Trump. His targeting and dismantling of systems supporting access, equity and accountability in American education isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s part of a broader pattern in an administration that has shown time and time again it is willing to weaponize federal power to silence dissent and reshape our country in its ideological image.</p>

    <p>Education will never be just a policy issue. It is the foundation of the democratic life we hold dear, the economic mobility passed through generations and the backbone of national resilience held in the face of uncertainty and violence. Gutted loan services, silenced civil rights offices and universities under threat are chilling examples of what happens when the state sees knowledge as a threat and public service as expendable and dehumanized.</p>

    <p>In the coming months and years, everyday Americans will bear the brunt of these impulsive and costly decisions. Families trying to send their kids to college and current students with federal loans like me will face confusing delays and the potential loss of aid. Borrowers counting on forgiveness will be forced into repayment limbo. Targeted universities will have no other option but to choose between academic freedom and financial survival.</p>

    <p>By law, the federal government’s job is to protect and expand access to education, not use it as a political bargaining chip for a broader and unfounded ideological war. America is stronger when education is properly funded, fairly administered and our leaders hold societal progression over their own quest for power.</p>

    <p>Institutions and governing branches are not powerless to Trump’s attacks. We need Congress to step in and assert its oversight role. We need state leaders, college presidents, educators, students, civil advocacy groups and everyone else to speak out and resist this gutting of the public trust. Our nation must foster generational advancement so that vibrant communities with access to economic mobility will be the norm in America. A less educated population will make our country lose talent, productivity and soft power across the globe.</p>

    <p>Now that the Department of Education is hollowed out, students' futures aren’t being streamlined. Rather, they are being gambled upon like business exploits in Trump’s unsuccessful management career.</p>
