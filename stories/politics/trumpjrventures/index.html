    <p>President Donald Trump is more than a patriarch of the Trump family: he is the face of a potent brand with a massive following in politics and business.</p>


    <p>While past presidents have sought to divest their financial interests during their terms, Trump has embraced using his presidential clout to enrich himself and his family.</p>


    <p>During the first six months of his second term, the Trump family's overall net worth has increased by billions, much of it through promoting, selling and licensing products marketed to Trump's populist MAGA movement.</p>


    <p>One of the biggest beneficiaries of Trump’s blend of politics and commerce has been his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.</p>


  <!--   <img src="/img/headstart.jpeg" id="bodyphoto">

    <div id="photocredit">First Head Start Program Opened in 1960. (Sutori - Sydney Lambert)</div> -->

    <p>After decades working in real estate and hospitality as an executive at the family-held Trump Organization, the president's eldest son has turned much of his attention to venture capital and taken on formal roles at several public companies.</p>

    <p>His latest venture was registered on Monday, New America Acquisition I Corp.</p>

    <!-- <div id="subheader">Access to education for low-income communities</div> -->

    <p>In initial securities filings, the firm pointed to the "relational networks" of its directors and advisors as one of its key strengths.</p>

    <p>"These relationships extend across verticals and into key areas of policymaking and capital formation, giving us access to deal flow, proprietary intelligence and strategic partners," the company wrote.</p>

    <p>Both descriptions were removed in an amended version of the document filed the same day.</p>

    <p>Early on, the ventures that Trump Jr. adds his name to seem bound for success.</p>

    <p>Shares typically skyrocket on the news that the president's son is going to be involved, as investors bet that the Trump name will open doors in Washington and fast-track the company for growth. </p>

    <p>“There’s a lot of retail investors who buy because they want to be on the side of Trump and his inner circle,” said Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management, who monitors online investor forums where Trump Jr.’s name draws attention. Tuttle owns shares of two ventures backed by the President’s son, Unusual Machines and GrabAGun.</p>

    <p>But an examination by The Analyst of the longer-term performance of three firms fronted by Trump Jr. in the past year reveals that each of them has lost since he assumed a position with the firms.</p>

    <div id="subheader">Unusual Machines</div>

    <p>Three weeks after Trump’s 2024 electoral victory, Unusual Machines, a little-known drone and drone components maker, was propelled to fame after announcing that the President’s son had joined its advisory board. </p>

    <p>An S-1 filing revealed that Trump Jr., who owned 131,580 shares acquired through a private placement offering, received an additional 200,000 shares as part of his advisory agreement.</p>

    <p>“Don Jr. joining our board of advisors provides us the unique expertise we need as we bring drone component manufacturing back to America," said CEO Allan Evans in a press release. </p>

    <p>In the filing, the drone maker, which is “heavily dependent on Chinese exports,” warned that then-President-elect Trump’s threatened tariffs could “materially and adversely affect” its business.</p>

    <p>“The need for drones is obvious," said Don Jr. in a statement, "I love what Unusual Machines is doing to bring drone manufacturing jobs back to the USA and am excited to take on a bigger role in the movement.”</p>

    <img src="/img/trumpjrventuresimage.jpeg" id="bodyphoto">

    <div id="photocredit">Donald Trump reveals his "Liberation Day" tariffs during a press conference at the Rose Garden on April 2, 2025.</div>

    <p>Despite the company’s concerns, shares of Unusual Machines rose more than 250% to a high of $23.62 in the week following Trump Jr.’s appointment.</p>

    <p>“All of these investors are looking for themes, and a lot of these themes are being turbocharged by Trump and the inner circle,” said Tuttle, “You’ve got a double whammy with Unusual Machines. You’ve got the drone theme, and you’ve got Trump Jr.’s involvement.”</a> 

    <p>Yet over six months into Trump's second term, the perceived benefits of Trump Jr.'s involvement have failed to materialize for Unusual Machines. According to a recent earnings report, Trump’s China tariffs have forced the company to place “larger inventory orders during the tariff pause” to avoid “reduced margins and higher costs.”</p>

    <p>While shares of Unusual Machines have doubled from their April low amid efforts by the U.S. military to grow its drone stockpile, the stock is still down nearly 50% from its Trump Jr.-fueled highs. </p>

    <div id="subheader">GrabAGun</div>

    <p>In June, GrabAGun, an online firearms retailer in which Trump Jr. is a board member, went public in a SPAC merger with Colombier Acquisition Corp. II, run by Republican party megadonor Omeed Malik.</p>

    <p>Malik also serves as president of the investment firm 1789 Capital, where Trump Jr. is a partner.</p>

    <p>“Today is an exciting moment and major milestone for our company,” said GrabAGun CEO Marc Nemati in a press release, “I look forward to taking advantage of the many opportunities in front of GrabAGun to enhance our platform and expand our market presence."</p>

    <p>Shares of the SPAC surged roughly 70% to an all-time high of $18.45 in the lead-up to the merger as investors raced to take a stake in the firm.</p>

    <p>Around this time, GrabAGun executives “got to go to Saudi Arabia and talk with the Sheiks” during President Trump’s state visit, according to Tuttle. Business executives in attendance included Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy.</p>

    <p>The White House did not respond to repeated requests for comment. </p>

    <p>Trump Jr. promoted the company’s debut in 10 separate posts to his over 15.2 million followers on X, alongside multiple TV appearances.</p>

    <p>In the hours after Trump Jr. rang the New York Stock Exchange opening bell to cheers of “USA” from the trading floor, shares of GrabAGun sank by nearly 20% to $13.12 per share. </p>

    <p>As of Wednesday’s close, the stock was trading at $6.69 per share, less than half of its pre-merger high.</p>

    <p>“I don’t think guns is ever going to be a real hot theme like drones is,” said Tuttle, “If we assume that, at least compared to Biden, Trump is a more law and order president, you could make an argument that maybe a couple of years ago people were thinking of buying guns, but now, maybe not.”</p>

    <div id="subheader">PublicSquare</div>

    <p>PublicSquare, an e-commerce site that describes itself as catering to “patriotic Americans” looking to “shop their values and put purpose behind their purchases,” went public in 2023 through a separate SPAC merger with Colombier Acquisition Corp.</p>

    <p>“There’s really this cool parallel economy ecosystem that really starts with consumer spending. We hate ESG and we hate DEI,” said PublicSquare CEO Michael Seifert in an interview with Breitbart, “We have big hopes for the future. We’re going to take over commerce and bring the power structures of society back toward we the people.”</p>

    <p>In December, Trump Jr. joined the company’s board of directors, sending shares surging over 250% to a midday high of $7.70.</p>

    <p>“PublicSquare has a distinct position in the market based on the core tenets of our nation’s founding,” said Trump Jr. in a press release, “The American people have affirmed the importance of liberty, and PublicSquare is at the forefront of this movement.”</p>

    <p>Despite investor optimism, Trump Jr.’s appointment has done little to ease the company’s difficulties turning a profit.</p>

    <p>The stock is down nearly 75% from its Trump Jr.-fueled high, with shares hovering near $2.00. Trading volume has declined from a high of 173 million to less than half a million today.</p>

    <p>“People on the right don’t invest based on their values, while people on the left are much more willing to do that,” said Tuttle.</p>

    <div id="subheader">Trump Put</div>

    <p>Despite the struggles of Trump Jr.’s ventures, some analysts, including Tuttle, remain optimistic.</p>

   <p>They believe that even if these companies falter, the backing of the president’s son provides a kind of “Trump put” investors can rely on.</p>

   <p>“Having the president's ear has its advantages,” said Tuttle, “I wouldn’t be surprised to see Trump come to his son’s rescue at some point.”</p>
